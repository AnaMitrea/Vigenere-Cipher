# Vigenere-Cipher
-

The Vignere Cipher is a method of encryting alphabetic text by using a series of interwoven Caesar ciphers, based on the letters of a keyword.

Encryption
-
-  Each letter is transformed into the ASCII value. In this way we work with the values 0-25 to calculate how much the filtered text shifts and in which letter the current letter is transformed.
-  A key is needed in order to algebrically encrypt the plain text.
